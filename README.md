# OverView

An IPhone to simulate an IPhone and some of its software.  
It's based on the IPhone of 2007, its apps are Safari, ITunes and Phone  
all are in the "Lite" version, for being very simple.

# Folders Structure

bin/ : contains the bytecode of the compilation, .class files.  
src/ : contains the .java files, the programs.  
lib/ : nothing really important, but it's fancy to have all the three folders.  

# How To Run

just clone the repository, enter on the folder and run the run.sh file.
<code>cd path/to/the/cloned/repository; sh run.sh;</code>  
another option is just go to the bin/ folder and run this code on the console (terminal).
<code>java iphone.IPhone;</code>
